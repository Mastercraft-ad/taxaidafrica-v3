CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
TAX-AID is governed by an Advisory Board, comprising reputable professionals from the taxation and broader business community. The Board provides strategic guidance and approves the organisation’s programmes.
The Advisory Board appoints an Executive Council responsible for day-to-day management, programme implementation, and ensuring alignment with the organisation’s strategic goals.
PERSONNEL & STAFFING
As a not-for-profit organisation, TAX-AID will operate largely through volunteers drawn from tax practice, financial services, academia, and related fields.
A volunteer portal known as “I VOLUNTEER” will be hosted on the organisation’s website to enable interested professionals to register and participate in capacity-building programmes.
 
I-VOLUNTEER
To ensure operational efficiency, TAX-AID will also maintain a small team of paid administrative and professional personnel to coordinate its activities and support programme delivery.
FUNDING
The promoters of TAX-AID provide initial funding. Thereafter, funding will be sourced from public donations, corporate supporters, donor agencies, charitable organisations, and relevant government entities.
TAX-AID also intends to seek inclusion in the Fifth Schedule to the Companies Income Tax Act, which will enable the organisation to receive tax-deductible donations from companies operating in Nigeria.
